PowerShell is consistently ranked among the top programming languages.
However, it is not generally considered to be a general-purpose language like [C](./c-lang.md) or [Python](./python.md).
So we were a little surprised to find at least some information about PowerShell and WebAssembly.

Most of it stems from the fact that the Blazor WebAssembly framework frequently uses PowerShell [in the examples](https://stackshare.io/stackups/powershell-vs-webassembly).

We think it is unlikely that PowerShell will ever be compiled to WebAssembly.
