Dart is a programming language designed for client development. The Dart team is
actively developing support for Wasm along with the Chrome team's work on
[Wasm-GC](https://chromestatus.com/feature/6062715726462976). The source code
for this work-in-process can be found
[in the Dart SDK repository](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/tree/main/pkg/dart2wasm).

## Pros and Cons

We will update this once `dart2wasm` has been released.

## Examples
