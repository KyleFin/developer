An experimental plugin that enables cron trigger for Spin applications. 

### Prerequisites
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* `pluginify` plugin (see below)

```bash
spin plugins install --url https://github.com/itowlson/spin-pluginify/releases/download/canary/pluginify.json
```

### Creating Spin App With Cron Trigger

After creating a Spin application and moving into the directory, add `cron_expression` as your desired trigger type in your application manifest and then specify the component you would like to handle that event on a seperate line. `cron_expression` follows standard cron syntax. The example below is triggered every 2 seconds).

```toml
[[trigger.cron]]
component = "<your-component-name>"
cron_expression = "1/2 * * * * *"
```
